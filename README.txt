To navigate the menu's, use the WS-keys, and select your option by pressing 'Space'.

To move the player use the 'WASD' keys to go up, left, down, right respectivly.
Use the spacebar to shoot bullets.
When in game, press 'P' to pause the game and open the menu.

Currently, 'New Game' and 'Continue Game' do the same thing.

When pausing in-game, the text for the 'Resume Game'-option disappears, but the button still works (it is the first option).

As explained in the design document, the overlay parameter of the world datatype is used for debugging purposes. 
There is a section in the 'updateWorld'-function of Controller.hs, mostly commented out, so it is not hard to find.
